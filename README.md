Welcome to my first complex website developed in 2019.
This project was an end-of-year course completion work
from the first year of the Technical Baccalaureate in Informatics in Ã‘emby, Paraguay.
It was created for an educational institution and contained information about
the facilities, descriptions of each grade, shift, and baccalaureates offered by the institution.
Note: The search feature should be modified with JavaScript and PHP.
